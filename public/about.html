<p>Jermaine Lamarr Cole (born January 28, 1985) is an American rapper, singer, 
  and record producer. Born on a military base in Germany and raised in Fayetteville,
  North Carolina,[4] Cole initially gained attention as a rapper following the release of his debut mixtape, 
  The Come Up, in early 2007. Intent on further pursuing a musical career,
  he signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation in 2009 and released two additional mixtapes: The Warm Up (2009) and Friday Night Lights (2010), 
  both to critical acclaim as he garnered a wider following.</p>

<p> Each of Cole's studio albums would peak the US Billboard 200 upon release,
  beginning with his debut Cole World: The Sideline Story (2011) and its follow up,
  Born Sinner (2013). The albums received critical acclaim and spawned hit singles including 
  "Work Out", "Power Trip" (featuring Miguel), and "Crooked Smile" (featuring TLC), 
  each charting within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100.[5] Despite commercial success, 
  Cole departed from the pop-oriented sound of the albums in favor of conscious subject matter for his subsequent projects;
  themes of nostalgia, racial inequality, and materialism were explored respectively in his subsequent releases:
  2014 Forest Hills Drive (2014), 4 Your Eyez Only (2017) and KOD (2018). The latter featured
  a then-record six simultaneous top twenty hits on the Billboard Hot 100, tying Cole's success
  with that of English rock band the Beatles.[6][7][8] His sixth studio album, The Off-Season
  (2021) was met with continued critical and commercial success. In 2023, Cole reached his furthest
  success on the Billboard Hot 100 for his guest appearances on Lil Durk's "All My Life" and Drake's
  "First Person Shooter", which peaked at numbers two and one respectively on the chart. "All My Life"
 also earned Cole his seventeenth and most recent Grammy Award nomination.</p> 
  
<p>Self-taught on piano, Cole also acts as a producer alongside his recording career—having largely handled the production 
  of his own projects—with credits on material for other artists including Kendrick Lamar, Janet Jackson, Young Thug, Wale, 
  and Mac Miller, among others.[9] Cole has been prolific in side ventures including his own record label Dreamville Records,
  as well as its namesake media company and non-profit.[10] The label, having signed artists including JID, Ari Lennox,
  and EarthGang, has released four compilation albums; their third project, 
  Revenge of the Dreamers III (2019) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was nominated for
  Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards. In January 2015, Cole began housing single mothers rent-free at his childhood
  home in Fayetteville, North Carolina.[11]</p>
  
<p>Cole has won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, a Billboard Music Award for Top Rap Album, three Soul Train Music Awards, 
  and eight BET Hip Hop Awards.[12][13] All six of his albums have been certified platinum by the Recording
  Industry Association of America (RIAA), as well as Revenge of the Dreamers II</p>
